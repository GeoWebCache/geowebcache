To set up an ExtJS development environment, download and 
unzip a full ExtJS SDK to this folder. Only ext-all.js and 
resource files will not be ignored by git (look at the 
.gitignore file in this folder).

To switch to the debug js file, depending on what page you 
are working on, find the <script> tag for ext-all.js and 
switch to ext-debug.js - which should now be at the same 
location (src/main/webapp/js/extjs/ext-debug.js)
