/**
 * This class comes from GeoTools
 *
 * Test support for test cases that require an "online" resource, such as an
 * external server or database.
 * <p>
 * Online tests work off of a "fixture". A fixture is a properties file which
 * defines connection parameters for some remote service. Each online test case
 * must define the id of the fixture is uses with {@link #getFixtureId()}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Fixtures are stored under the users home directory, under the "<code>.geotools</code>"
 * directory. Dots "." in the fixture id represent a subdirectory path under this
 * configuration file directory. For example, a fixture id <code>a.b.foo</code> would be
 * resolved to <code>.geotools/a/b/foo.properties<code>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * In the event that a fixture does not exist, the test case is
 * aborted.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Online tests connect to remote / online resources. Test cases should do all
 * connection / disconnection in the {@link #connect} and {@link #disconnect()}
 * methods.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The default behaviour of this class is that if {@link #connect()} throws an exception, the test
 * suite is disabled, causing each test to pass without being run. In addition, exceptions thrown by
 * {@link #disconnect()} are ignored. This behaviour allows tests to be robust against transient
 * outages of online resources, but also means that local software failures in {@link #connect()} or
 * {@link #disconnect()} will be silent.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * To have exceptions thrown by {@link #connect()} and {@link #disconnect()} cause tests to fail,
 * set <code>skip.on.failure=false</code> in the fixture property file. This restores the
 * traditional behaviour of unit tests, that is, that exceptions cause unit tests to fail.
 * </p>
