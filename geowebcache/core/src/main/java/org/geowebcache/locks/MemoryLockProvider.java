/**
 * An in memory lock provider.
 * <p>
 * This provider does not constrain the number of locks that can be held at any given time.
 * Because any one thread can hold multiple locks at a time, a more appropriate approach
 * to constraining resource usage would be to limit the number of concurrent threads instead.
 * <p>
 * One objective of this class is to <a href="https://github.com/GeoWebCache/geowebcache/issues/1226">support
 * nested locking scenarios</a>. This class used to use a striped lock algorithm which
 * would cause deadlocks for nested locking because of the non-predictable manner in
 * which any lock can be arbitrarily locked by another unrelated lock. An example use case of
 * nested locks, in pseudocode, would be:
 * <pre>
 *  lock(metatile);
 *  try {
 *      for(tile : metatile.getTiles()){
 *          lock(tile);
 *          try{
 *              ... do work
 *           } finally {
 *               release(tile);
 *          }
 *      }
 *  } finally {
 *      release(metatile);
 *  }
 * </pre>
